## 🛠️ Project Overview

This project demonstrates the use of *analog electronics* in arithmetic computation by designing an *Analog IQ Calculator. The system performs **Addition* and *Subtraction* using LM741 Op-Amps and extends functionality to *Logarithmic and Anti-Logarithmic operations* via a custom *Temperature Compensation Unit*.

Additionally, the system is integrated with an *Arduino interface* that processes user inputs, applies BODMAS logic, and displays results with *two-decimal precision*.
